How to Contribute

Find a bug?

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch. We may choose not to accept pull requests without tests, or for other reasons.

Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
